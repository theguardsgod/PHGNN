Install ProG and Pytorch

## Dataset Preparation
The data can be accessed at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/ 
Please follow this work for pre-processing
Task-Induced Pyramid and Attention GAN for Multimodal Brain Image Imputation and Classification in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease


## How to train
See the new_train.ipynb

## Improving this Work
At the time of writing this repo, it is not complete with clean running pipeline and the experiments are running on interactive notebook. We will make the code scriptable after 

## Acknowledgement
This project is built upon the foundations of several open-source codebases, including [camull-net](https://github.com/McSpooder/camull-net).
